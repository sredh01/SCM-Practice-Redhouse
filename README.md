### Configuration Management

### What is SCM?
Software Configuration Management (SCM) is a set of activities designed to manage change when it comes to building computer software. Its a process within software development that happens at all stages to ensure integrity. It is not to be confused with software support. The difference between the two lies within the production stage of software. SCM begins when software development begins and ends only when when the software is set to be released. Software support is what happens after software has been delivered and finished its development stages. 

SCM activites are develop in 5 stages:
1. Identify Change
2. Control Change
3. Ensure the change is being properly implemented
4. Ensure to report changes to others who may have interest
5. Publish/Deploy software

Additionally, while there are designated positions for SCM, it still falls on everyone to understand and use SCM processes and tools to help identify, organize, control, and report modifications.

### How does GitHub support SCM?
GitHub helps with SCM by their platforms core function, to host and manage Git repositories. Github offers features like the version control, branching, collaboration tools, and code review, all of which are essential in managing and tracking changes within software development. With these tools multiple developers are able to work on the same project simultaneously, see changes and share their projects.
